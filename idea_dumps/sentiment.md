🔹 Goal
Train a sentiment analysis model that processes bank-related customer reviews (per branch or region), summarizes general insights (positive/negative themes), and integrates results into your BIPBIP web dashboard.

✅ Step-by-Step Outline
1. Data Collection
🔍 What to Gather
Public Reviews: Collect user reviews per branch from:


Google Maps (via Google Places API)


Facebook Pages (if accessible via Meta Graph API)


Twitter/X or forums (for general sentiment)


Synthetic Data (Optional):


Use GPT-style prompts to generate domain-specific review data (banking context, per branch).


Include variations in language (Taglish, regional tone, etc.)


📌 Tips
Filter reviews by branch name or location keywords.


Use scraping tools (e.g., SerpAPI, Selenium, or BeautifulSoup) if API limits are restrictive.



2. Preprocessing the Reviews
Clean text: remove emojis, special chars, irrelevant text


Language detection: auto-detect Tagalog/English for hybrid NLP processing


Tokenization & Lemmatization: convert text to tokens, normalize


Optional: Translate Tagalog to English before sentiment analysis (using Google Translate API)



3. Model Training (Sentiment Analysis)
🤖 Approaches
Pretrained Transformer:


Start with BERT, RoBERTa, or DistilBERT fine-tuned on sentiment data


Optionally train a custom Taglish model (if you're getting a lot of local language)


Pipeline:


Input: Review Text


Output: Polarity score (Positive, Neutral, Negative) + Topics (optional)


📁 Labeling
Use open-source datasets (e.g., SentiPolc, Filipino Sentiment Dataset) for bootstrapping


Optionally manually label 500–1000 reviews (active learning)



4. Insight Aggregation
Group sentiment by branch name / location.


Create metadata:


Overall Score: % positive, % neutral, % negative


Highlighted keywords or phrases (e.g., “long wait,” “helpful staff”)


Assign branch-level "Sentiment Health Score" (e.g., 0–100 scale)



5. Tech Stack Recommendation

6. Sample Prompting for Synthetic Data
You can use this prompt for generating synthetic data via GPT:
text
CopyEdit
Generate a realistic customer review for a bank located in [CITY] named [BRANCH NAME]. The review should reflect a [positive/negative/neutral] experience. Include reasons such as wait time, teller behavior, efficiency, or cleanliness. Write it in Taglish.

Repeat across multiple sentiments and branches to enrich your dataset.

🦋 Optional: “Butterfly Insight”
Each branch insight could be visualized as a butterfly "wing" color or pattern—symbolizing sentiment strength. 🟢 (positive), 🟡 (neutral), 🔴 (negative). This aligns visually with your branding.
