BIPBIP - Branch Intelligence Platform: AI Development Outline
Overall Project Context
BIPBIP is an AI-powered branch analytics platform designed to transform BPI's 1,250+ branch operations through real-time data integration and predictive insights. The platform creates a digital twin of the branch network, combining historical operational data with real-time feeds from BEA (Branch Electronic Assistant) kiosks to optimize customer flow, staff productivity, and service delivery.
Core Value Proposition: Convert operational blind spots into actionable intelligence, reducing wait times by 50%, improving staff efficiency by 30%, and preventing customer churn through predictive analytics.

Data Requirements & Model Training Strategy
Datasets to Acquire/Create
Primary Training Data:
Transaction Logs Dataset
Source: Simulate BEA transaction data
Structure: timestamp, branch_id, transaction_type, duration, staff_id, customer_id
Size: 100K+ records covering 6+ months
Customer Review Dataset
Source: Web scraping + synthetic generation
Structure: review_text, rating, branch_id, date, platform
Processing: Sentiment labeling, Filipino text normalization
Branch Performance Dataset
Source: Combine operational metrics
Structure: branch_id, date, avg_wait_time, staff_count, transaction_volume, satisfaction_score
Model Training Pipeline:
Data Preprocessing: Clean, normalize, feature engineering
Model Selection: A/B testing of algorithms per use case
Validation Strategy: Time-based splits for temporal data
Performance Monitoring: Automated model drift detection
Success Metrics:
Transaction Time Prediction: <15% MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)
Sentiment Analysis: >85% accuracy on Filipino/English mixed text
Customer Flow Prediction: >90% accuracy for next-day predictions
Churn Prediction: >80% precision, >70% recall


Required Columns
city, branch_name, address, latitude, longitude (you have these)
review_text - the actual review content
rating - numerical score (1-5 stars)
language - to track Tagalog/English/Taglish
sentiment - positive/negative/neutral (your target label)
Getting Review Data
Scraping Google Maps reviews:
Technically possible but against Google's Terms of Service
Google Places API has review data but limited (5 most helpful reviews per place)
Consider using legitimate review APIs or datasets instead
Manual Collection:
More reliable and legal
Start with 50-100 reviews per branch as baseline
Focus on diverse rating ranges (1-5 stars)
Handling Tagalog/English/Taglish
Preprocessing:
Use language detection libraries (langdetect, polyglot)
Create unified vocabulary by translating everything to English first
Or train multilingual embeddings that handle code-switching
Data Augmentation:
Paraphrase existing reviews using translation (Tagalog→English→Tagalog)
Generate synthetic reviews using ChatGPT/Claude with Filipino context
Use back-translation techniques
Create Taglish variations of English reviews
Model Approach:
Use multilingual models like mBERT or XLM-R
Or preprocess everything to one language
Include language as a feature in your model
