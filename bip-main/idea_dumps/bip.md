PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The Bank of the Philippine Islands (BPI), with its extensive network of approximately 1,250 branches and a customer base of 16 million, is facing mounting operational inefficiencies that hinder both service delivery and customer satisfaction. Over the years, key performance indicators have declined: average customer wait times have increased from 4.46 to 5.08 minutes, with underperforming branches reaching 6.59 minutes. Simultaneously, teller productivity has dropped by 19%, and labor costs per transaction have surged by 148%, indicating a widening gap between resource input and service output.
These inefficiencies directly impact customer experience. While branch satisfaction has been shown to influence overall bank satisfaction twice as much as digital channels, inconsistent service quality and slow response times remain prevalent. Staff warmth and responsiveness are proven drivers of satisfaction, contributing to 35% and 28% increases, respectively, but are difficult to maintain without actionable, real-time operational insight. Compounding this issue is the industry-wide churn rate of 15–25% annually, with 20–25% of new customers leaving within their first year, often due to poor in-branch onboarding and long wait times.
Despite the surge in digital usage, accounting for over 90% of BPI's transaction volume, physical branches remain essential. Nearly half of account holders still prefer in-person services, with a majority visiting branches up to four times annually. However, BPI lacks dynamic, AI-powered tools that integrate physical and digital data to proactively monitor, simulate, and optimize customer flow, staffing levels, and service delivery across its branch network.
This growing disconnect between digital efficiency and physical service performance exposes a critical need for a unified analytics platform. Without intelligent systems that enable branch managers to make real-time, data-driven decisions, operational blind spots persist, threatening customer retention, revenue, and the sustainability of BPI's phygital banking strategy.



This raises a critical question:
How can BPI develop and implement a unified, AI-powered analytics platform that integrates physical and digital customer data to enable real-time optimization of branch operations, reduce customer wait times, improve staff productivity, and enhance the overall phygital banking experience while reducing operational costs and customer churn?

PROJECT DESCRIPTION
BIPBIP, or the Branch Intelligence Platform, is a comprehensive web-based analytics solution that creates a real-time digital twin of BPI's branch network. The platform combines live operational data, customer sentiment analysis, and predictive modeling to provide branch managers with actionable insights for optimizing daily operations, preventing customer churn, and improving overall branch performance.
By integrating physical branch data with digital channel analytics, the platform enables BPI to deliver a seamless "phygital" experience while maximizing operational efficiency across all touchpoints.
