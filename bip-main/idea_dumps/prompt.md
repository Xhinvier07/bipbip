help me create a markdown for my project Branch intelligence platform bip.md , it will be a basis for ai agent like trae to have a better context and outline. create key markdowns that are needed such as, Frontend, Backend, machine learning (training a sentiment analysis based from my dataset), and other files needed, also state what are needed dataset thats is needed for development, like branch locations address, and latitude and longitude for mapping, i will be using react vite (js), google api for anything related for maps, supabase for database related or anything needed or google sheet instead, for now im done with branch data with the collected/scrape rating for branches, now what i want to do is to make a general sentiment for the reviews for each branch, and to augment it or make other synthetic data populator  or gather more data to expand it.

check other md for my outline or rough ideas to understand my project, i want it to semi functional that i can train machine learning separately and just utilize certain data in my frontend, since this is just mvp and i want it still presentable for a hackathon to have an impact, outline properly the frontend, backend, training, datasets needed

for example for frontend, typography needed, color, (etc we are currently using the logo with this color combination, #fea000 #cf3d58 #c95a94 #bc7eff ), etc etc, components, libraries, etc
