Simulation



Simulation is a 2d/3d map of the branch where the customer flow can be simulated, transactions, average transaction time with the following variables (experimental there should be a coefficient for this to simulate it, it will also different according to month and day for a bank branch simulation)

SENTIMENT ANALYSIS - There would be a machine learning training for sentiment analysis for every bank reviews, and there would be a general review/insights about the bank coming from the trained output for the reviews, and it will be now displayed to the bip bip web application.

Map
Centered map, right panel for top for overall description statistics, right bottom for simulation
There is a search bar at the top left of the map overlaid with filter next to it
Can be filter by City
Can be filter by Low/High BHS
Can be filter by Low/High Transactions
Simulation panel is inputtable/sliders, that can see changes in the overall description statistics panel how it can fluctuate for that day
Please take note that Month/Day can affect the fluctuation, since payday, season types can affect this, there should be a coefficient multiplier or changer that can affect certain variables for the simulation (with button to simulate or reset or go to 2d simulation)
Future plan if BIP will be the future platform there would be an AI/Machine learning that will learn throughout the years of data of BPI transactions coming from BEA
