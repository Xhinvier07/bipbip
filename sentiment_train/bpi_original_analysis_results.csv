I was assisted ng mabilis and my concern was resolved so this time I only stay for 30 to 45 mins the most. Nag ready ako baka kase kailangan ko na namang makatulog sa pila pero hindi kase wala na silang pila. Staffs were very friendly and accommodating from the guard.

Another thing they have an open floor plan na maganda and mabilis na din yung transaction. Nakakatuwa lang from No star 🌟 na rating ko sa kanila before to 5 stars 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 na sila sa akin today😊.

I was here last Thursday 19May 2022. And yes I fell asleep waiting on queue  4 times. That's how bad their customer service is, been waiting in line for almost 4 hours. And most of those waiting with me already left, I do hope that they have sense of urgency especially on new account openings. They don't care with people at all. Very very bad customer service.

After waitng for almost an hour, someone would pick up the call and intentionally remainng silent, despite my attempts to communicate. After a few minutes, they would either put me on hold or shuffle me back into the queue. This pattern persisted throughout my entire waiting time, leading me to believe that there was a deliberate effort to avoid engaging with customers.

The staff on the branch cannot be blamed either, as they are trying their best to be as accommodating as possible to every person they're talking to.

There's like 10 more people waiting, the last one probably doesn't have any idea of the frustration in store for him.

If you have anything you need processed here, you have to make sure you have half of your day to waste. We've waited at the customer service for an hour and a half. We came in and they were serving #13 and we left an hour and a half later and it was still #15. Seriously, what?!

One of the machines for getting your waiting number is broken. So you have to wait behind a bunch of people trying to figure out how to operate a barely responsive touch-screen machine.

BPI Pasay Road Branch,"It has been almost 4 years since I last visited the BPI Family in Arnaiz, which had been my bank for decades (as in, in my early 20s, am in my mid 40s now). BPI Family got merged with this BPI branch last year, so I was shocked when I saw that my bank was no longer where it used to be.

Anyway, thanks to Google Maps, I was able to find this, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they've streamlined their processes. It's not packed with people (which is very common with BPI branches near and inside malls), and was divided into two areas.

I inquired as to whether this was the branch that got merged with my bank, and they were very helpful in issuing my checkbook as well as processing my ATM card request (which they'll send to the branch nearest to me). All in all, a very pleasant visit.

What I also like about this branch: the building has a washroom that's accessible to guests.

BPI Mandaluyong Greenfield District Branch,"Very busy bank with lots of customers. I hope there are more branches I think waiting 1 hour to do a bank transaction is too long.

My queue number was 98, and they were attending to 81 when I arrived. Supposedly, it took about an hour to get from 81 to 98, which is roughly 4 mins per customer. Although they didn't really serve 17 customers, because they skip numbers when some customers already left due to the long waiting time, and certain counters only process cash deposits up to a certain amount, so have to wait for other counters to finish.  They have 7 tellers, only 5 were being used, but still took a while. Also, there was this 1 counter, which was serving 1 customer for more than 30mins (by the time I left, the customer was still at that counter).

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,Female employee at counter 8 was quite unprofessional. Even when her colleague said my transaction was valid she kept repeating the question without even trying it out. Even asked unnecessary questions whether there were no nearer bpi branches from my company. She was also snacking in front of me while processing my transaction.

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,"If there is the worst BPI branch, it will have to be this one. No priority lane for PWDs and Senior Citizens. No regard for time of the clients. One transaction happens in more than 1 hour and there are only two (2) staff. I would understand especially if the bank staff are apologetic about it, we all need to be patient, yes. But wow, there are ad hoc policies that aggravate the situation considering that clients have been waiting for hours to process transactions. I arrived at 12:00 pm today, the queue was not that long, I was number 30 and I was there to just claim a checkbook. They were serving number 18 when I arrived. I talked to the BPI security guard to leave my number for safekeeping because I need to eat my lunch. Fast forward to 2:00 pm, they are at number 21. I needed to do some work so I said to the guard that I’ll be back before the branch closes at 4:30 pm. I was here at 4:00 pm, and they are serving 34. But the security guard says, my number has already been called so I need to be given another number — 50. Wow, never mind the total time I waited but the consideration given to clients is almost non-existent. They did let me in because I was practically shouting unfair treatment (he didn’t even say that tiny policy that I need to restart my queue if I was not there when it’s my turn!) — he said I should be the one to talk to the bank staff inside. I am too tired to argue so I was thankful that the bank staff just asked for my number and ID to proceed. I just wish bank staff extend consideration to their enduring clients. Do they expect people to wait around like it’s the only agenda they have for the day? And more importantly, that BPI improves their client services.

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,"This branch during early midday to noon hours gets extremely crowded. Never visit this branch during that time.

Customers who visit this bank before 12:00 PM might end up finishing their transactions at 1:30 PM or even at 2 PM, 3 PM, or 4 PM (worst case scenario): because there is a lunch break for some staff here.

How about closing hours? Does the service get better? Not really. The service is still sluggish even nearing closing hours.

Decided to open an account with this bank even though the branch of the main bank is only two tamblings and one dura, because they don't know how to answer the phone as in all the family savings branches that I have called, they answer. Their main counterpart bank really sucks. I had to drop by my previous bank just to fix my account, ending up I need to open a new account and because I don't know what they need, I have to go back. I didn't come back, why do I have to come back? Char! I felt I made a great choice choosing this bank. Careful, friendly and even if it takes a long time, you're sure you can fix what you went to that same day. Additionally, I no longer feel like I'm just a small customer. Same good service the way the big customers are assisted (like there are no better seats for richer customers, then the guards and bankers and tellers are friendly all the way to everyone, are they like that).

BPI FTI Taguig Branch,"Dear BPI Customer Service,

Good day.

I would like to raise a concern regarding my recent experience at your BPI FTI branch. I claimed my debit card, which I requested online. The entire online process went smoothly, and I was grateful for that. However, my in-branch experience was disappointing due to the behavior of the staff who assisted me.

Upon entering the branch, the staff assigned on the left side (from the entrance) assisted me. She asked if I requested my card online, to which I responded “yes.” She asked another question, and I also answered politely. However, I noticed that she began mumbling or whispering to herself. When she photocopied my ID, she did it in a noticeably irritated manner, as if annoyed. Then when she asked me to sign the copy, she handed me the pen in a way that felt disrespectful — almost like tossing it toward me.

What made me uncomfortable was how unprofessional her demeanor was. If she was upset or displeased about something — whether due to my lack of knowledge about the “Digital Update” process (which I was unaware of, since this is my first BPI account and was done online) — I believe it could’ve been handled in a better manner. Customers should not feel they are being treated with irritation or frustration.

Eventually, I was transferred to another counter, directly opposite hers. The person there was much more respectful, accommodating, and professional — which I truly appreciated.

I’m sharing this feedback not out of anger, but in the hope that better customer service can be given to all clients regardless of their level of familiarity with your processes. First impressions matter, and respectful interaction is a big part of customer trust and satisfaction.

Thank you for taking the time to read my concern. I hope this helps improve future client experiences.",2,a week ago,"dear bpi customer service, good day. i would like to raise a concern regarding my recent experience at your bpi fti branch. i claimed my debit card, which i requested online. the entire online process went smoothly, and i was grateful for that. however, my inbranch experience was disappointing due to the behavior of the staff who assisted me. upon entering the branch, the staff assigned on the left side from the entrance assisted me. she asked if i requested my card online, to which i responded yes. she asked another question, and i also answered politely. however, i noticed that she began mumbling or whispering to herself. when she photocopied my id, she did it in a noticeably irritated manner, as if annoyed. then when she asked me to sign the copy, she handed me the pen in a way that felt disrespectful  almost like tossing it toward me. what made me uncomfortable was how unprofessional her demeanor was. if she was upset or displeased about something  whether due to my lack of knowledge about the digital update process which i was unaware of, since this is my first bpi account and was done online  i believe it couldve been handled in a better manner. customers should not feel they are being treated with irritation or frustration. eventually, i was transferred to another counter, directly opposite hers. the person there was much more respectful, accommodating, and professional  which i truly appreciated. im sharing this feedback not out of anger, but in the hope that better customer service can be given to all clients regardless of their level of familiarity with your processes. first impressions matter, and respectful interaction is a big part of customer trust and satisfaction. thank you for taking the time to read my concern. i hope this helps improve future client experiences.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive
BPI FTI Taguig Branch,"I checked your reviews and with other BPI branches and all we do have same concerns for you, very slow customer service. I had to wait for almost 3 hours just to sign my loan application and you informed me that it will take 3 to 5 banking days( I was really looking forward to it since I really badly needed it for my father's medical bill) to credit it to my account but its been a week and yet i did not received anything on my account. I've been calling your customer service many times for almost a day, yes you read it right! I've been calling many times in the morning and afternoon but no one is answering both the customer hot line and the phone hot line from Green Belt 5.

They were also not able to give us an exact time on when the Debit Card will be available on that day.

Walking out of the branch, it made me realize, it hasn't been 3 months yet. I went back to the branch and informed her about it.

BPI Commonwealth Branch,"I opened a secured credit card with them, hoping they’d give me a regular CC after a year. But almost three years passed and I still didn’t get one, so I decided to close it instead. I called customer service, and the agent told me I could go to a branch to request account closure and apply for a regular card afterward. So I went to the Comm branch, since that’s where my account was opened. After waiting in a long queue, I spoke to a girl sitting on the third seat from the left (sorry, I didn’t catch her name since I just came from a night shift). She told me they couldn’t process my request because there was still a balance — ₱29,000+ at the time. Since I had more than enough held funds in the account, I told her to just deduct it from there so I could close the account. I even said I was no longer interested in getting the regular credit card if they couldn’t provide it. But she refused, saying I needed to pay the balance first before they could release the hold. She also told me I could either pay it off or wait three months without making any payments, then request for closure. I was about to follow their advice, but then I started getting calls from a collection agency asking me to pay at least the minimum amount — which I did, even though I was really confused at that point. Month after month, I kept seeing my account get worse, so I called BPI customer service again. That’s when I was told that what the branch staff said was wrong — they could’ve processed the closure on their end, lifted the hold, and then applied the funds to pay off the balance. Because of that misinformation, my balance ballooned to ₱35,000 and I ended up paying it off just to settle everything. I even paid the remaining charges, all because of the wrong advice I got from that branch. Now, my case with the BSP and your department is still ongoing, and honestly, I’m really disappointed with the service I received from BPI.",1,2 weeks ago,"i opened a secured credit card with them, hoping theyd give me a regular cc after a year. but almost three years passed and i still didnt get one, so i decided to close it instead. i called customer service, and the agent told me i could go to a branch to request account closure and apply for a regular card afterward. so i went to the comm branch, since thats where my account was opened. after waiting in a long queue, i spoke to a girl sitting on the third seat from the left sorry, i didnt catch her name since i just came from a night shift. she told me they couldnt process my request because there was still a balance  29,000 at the time. since i had more than enough held funds in the account, i told her to just deduct it from there so i could close the account. i even said i was no longer interested in getting the regular credit card if they couldnt provide it. but she refused, saying i needed to pay the balance first before they could release the hold. she also told me i could either pay it off or wait three months without making any payments, then request for closure. i was about to follow their advice, but then i started getting calls from a collection agency asking me to pay at least the minimum amount  which i did, even though i was really confused at that point. month after month, i kept seeing my account get worse, so i called bpi customer service again. thats when i was told that what the branch staff said was wrong  they couldve processed the closure on their end, lifted the hold, and then applied the funds to pay off the balance. because of that misinformation, my balance ballooned to 35,000 and i ended up paying it off just to settle everything. i even paid the remaining charges, all because of the wrong advice i got from that branch. now, my case with the bsp and your department is still ongoing, and honestly, im really disappointed with the service i received from bpi.",Negative,Negative,Negative,Negative,Positive,Positive

One more issue is that when i asked the exchange of usd to pesos when i came in, it's different when it's already my turn. Why? because 2 hours have passed!

The number queuing system is completely unreliable. It constantly skips numbers to prioritize larger transactions, leaving regular customers waiting for hours.

On top of that, the tellers provide poor service and display unprofessional attitudes. Instead of assisting efficiently, they contribute to the delay and make the experience even more frustrating.

BPI Fort Serendra Branch,"Huge regret opening an account here. I should have run the opposite direction when the teller kept insisting I didn’t have enough documents even after I pointed out that the BPI official website said I do. I was getting extremely frustrated and asked to see the manager.

He was sitting right beside her. As in, RIGHT BESIDE. When I explained AGAIN that I had exactly what their website said I needed to open account, he finally intervened and told the teller to “let” me open an account.

After that delightful encounter, it’s been pretty much downhill since then. Waiting time is at least 1.5 hours  for just one transaction.  You’ll see a long queue of people with only 3 tellers who look like they’ve got all the time in the world.

So disgusting experience today. My number is only 7 away from the number called, there were only a few people but it took me 1 hour and 30 minutes because of the slowness before my number was called.

First issue is that they don't follow the number sequencing.. they jump to the higher number to serve whoever they want first and they will go back to the lower one if they want.

What's the point of having numbering if you're shopping for something to serve?

And their noisy employees chat and joke with each other like they're just a market.. hey that's a bank not a market!!! You're noisy and slow service.

The WORST Queuing System – Inefficient and Frustrating

I arrived at 1:50 PM, and it’s now 4:00 PM. Despite most tellers being available, they won’t assist me because my transaction doesn’t fall under their assigned category. Instead, I’m forced to wait for the specific teller assigned to my transaction type, who happens to be extremely slow.

The purpose of a queuing system should be to prioritize the first customer who arrives. However, this system categorizes queues, creating unfair situations. If your transaction is assigned to a slow teller, you could end up waiting for over two hours, while customers who arrived after you are done in just five minutes. This is completely unreasonable.

BPI UP Town Center Branch,"Rude guard/s.

Went here July 30, 2025 around 4:30pm and used their withdraw machine (only one was usable as the other one was offline).

Realized I brought the wrong BPI card while checking on the machine so I had to transfer funds online and try to withdraw again.

I tried and waited a bit, only to realize my card wasn’t fully inserted. Upon properly placing the card, the machine stated “card/account restricted”.

Tried waiting for a minute only for the guard to muffle “offline na yan”. I asked the guard to say again and he said “wala na, in-offline mo na yan” so I asked why. He said “hindi niyo kasi ininsert yung card ng maayos eh” while smirking.

Was dismayed and just left saying “ay. sige.”. On my way out heard the guard say to the other guard “isa na nga lang machine, inoffline pa”.

I get that it’s my fault for not catching the issue right away. Pero instead of assisting early on, pinanood niya lang ako hindi ma insert ng maayos yung card at mag error ng tuluyan. Worse is, pa ngisi ngisi pa when pointing it out.

On my way out of the mall (around 6:20pm), passed by and saw working na ulit yung machine. May pila na eh. Didn’t withdraw cos didn’t want to see the guard anymore.

BPI U.P. Techno Hub Branch,"Yesterday (May 4), I went to BPI technohub to do withdrawal and deposit. I got my number and waited for my number (206) to be called. When 205 was called I moved closer to teller #1 thinking that I'm next, as I'm at the far end of the room. Then she skipped my number so I asked why, she pointed at Teller #3 who'll process my transaction without any more explanations. I then moved back closer to Teller #3 waiting for may turn. I stood and  waited in front of Teller #3. At first she told me to sit down but I didnt, thinking that the current transaction wont take too long. After a few minutes (probably 5mins) I heard that Teller #1 is already processing #212. I was now pissed as there was no point in getting a number if they're not processing accordingly. So I turned to Teller #3 and told her to not get any number that she can't process immediately. I was shocked that she yelled at me saying  she already told me to sit down earlier and wait for her to finish what she's doing.I wasn't able to react as I was embarassed. There were so many people inside the bank. I sat down and waited for her to call my number. I was calming myself since I didnt want to burst in anger, or cry. At that point Teller #1 is already processing 215 while I was clueless and was just waiting for my number to be called. When she called my number I told her to explain to clients properly so we wont get angry. If she had explained earlier that teller #1 can only doch transactions, I would have waited patienty and not complained. Teller #3 did not even apologize. She processed my transaction as if nothing happened.  btw, her name is SHIELA (from her nameplate). she is the most disrespectful bank employee that I have encountered in my life.
