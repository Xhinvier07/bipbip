I am happy üòä on the service given to me today. Grabeh huh, very good sa improvement ng service from last year. Today walang pila, walang number for waiting. As in nakakatuwa na ang bilis ng Customer service nila. I have 2 concerns to be addressed and both were actioned in a timely manner. Upon entry, may 2 personnel na sila ready to assist one for online banking and then the other one is for their miscellaneous bank account. I was assisted ng mabilis and my concern was resolved so this time I only stay for 30 to 45 mins the most. Nag ready ako baka kase kailangan ko na namang makatulog sa pila pero hindi kase wala na silang pila. Staffs were very friendly and accommodating from the guard.

Another thing they have an open floor plan na maganda and mabilis na din yung transaction. Nakakatuwa lang from No star üåü na rating ko sa kanila before to 5 stars üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü na sila sa akin todayüòä.

======================

I was here last Thursday 19May 2022. And yes I fell asleep waiting on queue  4 times. That's how bad their customer service is, been waiting in line for almost 4 hours. And most of those waiting with me already left, I do hope that they have sense of urgency especially on new account openings. They don't care with people at all. Very very bad customer service.

Such a waste of time as always. Make the best out of your time by BPI, boredom as always.

Tip: Try other branches like BPI southmall or the BPI in front of southmall, mas mabilis sila in terms of customer service. Also when going on this branch, bring some  things to kill your boredom or use the e-queue. Don't go here for walk-in transactions and this will be the only activity you will have for the day.

So, I told the cashier that I would only deposit the other two. She told me that I had to get a new number and fall in line again just to do that. That I would have to wait for at least an hour again. It would've been okay if they had a good system and that the waiting time is short, but they don't. Can't understand why they would treat their customers this way. A total waste of time. In addition to that, I was using my phone to check the account details for my transaction.

The guard even warned me they can see me in the CCTV. Wow.

Its not my first time I used a cellphone inside other BPI branches when I see everyone is also using it since I was logging to their bank's mobile app. I DID stop using my phone but some customers are still using it. The cellphone policy should apply to all. Is it just I am not wearing any flashy jewelry that time?

An hour and a half later, they're still serving the same customer. I only have an hour to spare for I need to go to work and I thought it would be enough but it wasn't. They're taking pictures of IDs, going back and forth to their backrooms but leaving empty handed, etc. like what are y'all doing in there?! I was given a number but its not being called and people are just racing to the stalls because of their unorganized queue process. The guards directed me to an incorrect line, even though I told them what my business is, which totally wasted my time.

On Dec. 4, 2023, I called your online customer service seeking support for a matter related to my account. I initially spoke with Grey (as she preferred to be addressed), who transferred me to another department. However, my ordeal began when I found myself waiting in line for almost two hours without any success in connecting to a customer service agent.

After waitng for almost an hour, someone would pick up the call and intentionally remainng silent, despite my attempts to communicate. After a few minutes, they would either put me on hold or shuffle me back into the queue. This pattern persisted throughout my entire waiting time, leading me to believe that there was a deliberate effort to avoid engaging with customers.

BPI J.P. Rizal Binakod Branch,"If you're visiting this branch for customer service transactions, consider going to a different branch. There is no way you can fit the wait time for customer service in your lunch break, you have to allocate a whole day for it. If you have teller transactions, be prepared to sit in line outside of the branch for two-three hours before you can even wait inside. They have 7 cubicles in the branch but two tellers are actually working, the other 5 cubicles are for managers or supervisors who will ignore you and continue in whatever they are doing. The people working at this branch have no concern for how long the queue already is as long as they go about their day to day work. Also prepare to face the two security guards that will shepherd you to whereever it is they think you need to go--one outdoor guard and one indoor guard. They will not know what you want to do, but they enjoy making you wait anyway. All in all, if whatever you need to do can be done at another branch, please take your business there.

BPI Magallanes South Branch,"Jesus Christ! Can you go any slower? The BPI process desperately needs updating. It doesn't work anymore when there's a lot of customers waiting.

The staff on the branch cannot be blamed either, as they are trying their best to be as accommodating as possible to every person they're talking to. But that's never going to work if there's only three customer service representatives and they take at least half an hour for each customer. There's like 10 more people waiting, the last one probably doesn't have any idea of the frustration in store for him.

If you have anything you need processed here, you have to make sure you have half of your day to waste. We've waited at the customer service for an hour and a half. We came in and they were serving #13 and we left an hour and a half later and it was still #15. Seriously, what?!

One of the machines for getting your waiting number is broken. So you have to wait behind a bunch of people trying to figure out how to operate a barely responsive touch-screen machine.

BPI Pasay Road Branch,"It has been almost 4 years since I last visited the BPI Family in Arnaiz, which had been my bank for decades (as in, in my early 20s, am in my mid 40s now). BPI Family got merged with this BPI branch last year, so I was shocked when I saw that my bank was no longer where it used to be.

Anyway, thanks to Google Maps, I was able to find this, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that they've streamlined their processes. It's not packed with people (which is very common with BPI branches near and inside malls), and was divided into two areas.

I inquired as to whether this was the branch that got merged with my bank, and they were very helpful in issuing my checkbook as well as processing my ATM card request (which they'll send to the branch nearest to me). All in all, a very pleasant visit.

What I also like about this branch: the building has a washroom that's accessible to guests. My original bank didn't have that.",5,2 years ago

When you change your ID with the government, it's been years since the ID was approved, so I brought the original marriage certificate and other docs. It's really too poor.

So I said no one else is approaching you, he is talking to you with a bit of rudeness, take note CUSTOMER, instead of him yelling and knowing that no one is coming, he is going to insult you, please do actions on this happenings, more on the people there are not customer friendly, it seems like they must be idolized, he doesn't have a name tag so he got the no. when the woman told teller 1, but attached files are my transaction awhile go, i hope you will do such proper action on this matter.. and 1 more thing, tell them more stories... thanks in advance",1,Edited 6 years ago

BPI Mandaluyong Greenfield District Branch,"I was required to open a bank account for my payroll here. although the waiting time was a bit longer than expected, the staff and bank personnel were really helpful and friendly. They were detailed and thorough when it came to the process, but they were also calm and patient when explaining and answering my questions. The place was quiet, air conditioned, and they provided comfy chairs. the guards were also helpful and respectful. Overall, it was a good experience unlike any other banks.",5,2 months ago
BPI Mandaluyong Greenfield District Branch,"Very busy bank with lots of customers. I hope there are more branches I think waiting 1 hour to do a bank transaction is too long.

My queue number was 98, and they were attending to 81 when I arrived. Supposedly, it took about an hour to get from 81 to 98, which is roughly 4 mins per customer. Although they didn't really serve 17 customers, because they skip numbers when some customers already left due to the long waiting time, and certain counters only process cash deposits up to a certain amount, so have to wait for other counters to finish.  They have 7 tellers, only 5 were being used, but still took a while. Also, there was this 1 counter, which was serving 1 customer for more than 30mins (by the time I left, the customer was still at that counter). So in a way, only 4 counters running efficiently.",1,8 months ago
BPI Mandaluyong Greenfield District Branch,"Legitimately the WORST bank I've had the displeasure of visiting.

I was queueing under the priority lane, and I informed the teller beforehand that I had a shift the same day. She assured me that it wouldn't take that long to finish my transaction.

A coworker of hers then proceeds to ask her how to handle a different customer, she then leaves me to assist said coworker for another half an hour, and asks me to complete a customer satisfaction survey while I wait. WHILE. I. WAIT.

In summary: ended up being late on my shift, not planning to complete any other transactions with this bank, avoid it like the plague, should've listened to all the other reviews",1,a year ago

BPI stands for Banking Personnel Incompetent.  Or Branch Painstakingly Inefficient.

Isn't it enough a check issued under my NAME and I presented SEVERAL IDs?(I do hope I will get an honest answer) attached is a screenshot of IDs valid and needed for check encashment, clearly that guy in window 1 has no idea of what he is talking about (very incompetent), I'm a businessman and several times my clients are issuing PDC most of the time, that check  I wanted to encash is for my workers salary, I do understand banks policy as I've been working in 1 before.

Over an hour and a half wait time and they're calling no one. They don't even have the ticket number for counters 1 and 2 showing.  If you're in a hurry avoid at all cost. The one caveat is that it is safe and the guards do a great job securing the place. Counters 3 and 4 seem to be running well also. However, customer service needs serious help, retraining, more staff, or something.

Edit: everyone working in the customer service department should be fired. The number of times I counted them walking around versus actually doing their jobs and helping customers is astounding.

She is so busy that she doesnt even have a second to greet her regular clients. They do not offer anything for you to maximize your deposit with them.

Then lining up is another story, there is a queuing system but calling is manual. There are few people but it takes a long time to call. 1 hr in line for transaction that would take only 5mins. Then the teller who will bang on the door will also have the attitude, what the H? Then you don't want to activate my card because it's damaged? Wow! Please change the ATM machine because even though my card was new, it was already captured. Payment of 200 for replacement is a small time scam but imagine if you ask everyone to do the same, right? It's a hassle. I hope you also invest in a strong card. I'll keep the same card and very minimal usage, but BPI is peeling, the rest of my cards are still in good condition, the others are even longer than BPI. Tag as damaged due to the flake, the officer said he didn't want to activate it. Your tellers are very impolite, gossip to the max and not focused.

BPI Ayala Malls Feliz Branch,"By far, the worst BPI branch I‚Äôve ever been to. I went here solely to get my bank certificate and statement for my visa requirements. I didn‚Äôt mind the long wait since it was a Saturday, but what made it worse was the teller hard-selling insurance to me. I highly discourage anyone from visiting this branch since the teller is too pushy, adamant about selling, and won‚Äôt take no for an answer. Her offer didn‚Äôt suit my lifestyle, yet she kept insisting even after I clearly said I wasn‚Äôt interested. This was extremely awkward for me, as I had no plans to avail of their services.

Then you will be debited for two months immediately and I have not received any documents about the insurance. I felt like being scammed. I hope you don't do anything else.

But the person I spoke to was deaf and couldn't understand the cancellation order & was not able to reach me back. So after 6 business days (08/13/2024) I went to the branch there and found out that there was no one waiting for me. Fine, that's fine. I requested to pick it up at the branch closest to us. I received an email on Thurs that my card would be delivered. (08/15/2024) I'm Uto Uto and I went to this branch. No more DW. Fine, I'll make sure to call 1st. Called on branch on Friday (08/16/2025) and there was DW. But I told the teller I'll get it on Monday since I'm tired at night shift.go DW. Monday(08/19/2024) card was given but DW system is down So I don't activate the card. I'll wait. No call on Tues & tested it now(08/21/2024) I thought maybe it's limited.

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,"If there is the worst BPI branch, it will have to be this one. No priority lane for PWDs and Senior Citizens. No regard for time of the clients. One transaction happens in more than 1 hour and there are only two (2) staff. I would understand especially if the bank staff are apologetic about it, we all need to be patient, yes. But wow, there are ad hoc policies that aggravate the situation considering that clients have been waiting for hours to process transactions. I arrived at 12:00 pm today, the queue was not that long, I was number 30 and I was there to just claim a checkbook. They were serving number 18 when I arrived. I talked to the BPI security guard to leave my number for safekeeping because I need to eat my lunch. Fast forward to 2:00 pm, they are at number 21. I needed to do some work so I said to the guard that I‚Äôll be back before the branch closes at 4:30 pm. I was here at 4:00 pm, and they are serving 34. But the security guard says, my number has already been called so I need to be given another number ‚Äî 50. Wow, never mind the total time I waited but the consideration given to clients is almost non-existent. They did let me in because I was practically shouting unfair treatment (he didn‚Äôt even say that tiny policy that I need to restart my queue if I was not there when it‚Äôs my turn!) ‚Äî he said I should be the one to talk to the bank staff inside. I am too tired to argue so I was thankful that the bank staff just asked for my number and ID to proceed. I just wish bank staff extend consideration to their enduring clients. Do they expect people to wait around like it‚Äôs the only agenda they have for the day? And more importantly, that BPI improves their client services.

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,"This branch during early midday to noon hours gets extremely crowded. Never visit this branch during that time. Aim to visit the branch at its opening hours, or visit another branch. The service is sluggish, messy, and inconsistent, where there has been no attempt for the staff to hasten the queuing process. I also feel like the staff here are living in their own isolated world, not voluntarily willing to serve their customers. Customers who visit this bank before 12:00 PM might end up finishing their transactions at 1:30 PM or even at 2 PM, 3 PM, or 4 PM (worst case scenario): because there is a lunch break for some staff here.

How about closing hours? Does the service get better? Not really. The service is still sluggish even nearing closing hours.

BPI Ortigas Emerald Branch,"I came here today to claim my EMV. I waited for almost two hours to get the card.

Finally, when it was just a few minutes short of two hours and I was losing my patience, I asked the staff if a new number should have been called already. They did not call a number at all in that duration.The customer service staff again told me to wait. The guard probably saw how exasperated I was and he told me to just go directly to the cubicle where the staff tasked to distribute the cards was stationed. I got the card in less than 5 minutes. If only the guard and the customer service staff told me to do exactly just that when I got to the bank! What's so difficult in that? I agree with what one reviewer said that there was no sense of urgency at all. The staff was grossly inefficient. My experience in BDO was the exact opposite.

BPI Pasig Amang Rodriguez Branch,"One of the worst bank branches I‚Äôve ever been to, if not the worst. There are always long queues, and even when there‚Äôs no line, they still make you wait. I had to wait a long time just to claim my card replacement. It was actually an agent from their Bancassurance team who assisted me after noticing that I had been waiting the entire time.

I also asked the staff why no one was answering their landline, which was the number provided to me by the hotline agent. She claimed it was the wrong number, but the same number was listed on Google. She then gave me a mobile number to contact, but when I told her that no one was answering, I even showed her my unanswered text messages. She then said they don‚Äôt respond to texts. I told her I had also been calling, but no one was picking up. At this point, it seemed like she was just making excuses.

Frustrated, I told her to keep the number she had written down since it was useless if no one was going to answer.

I had an extremely frustrating experience at this BPI branch. The process is painfully slow, with only one counter attending to all customers while a significant number of admin staff were visibly idle, chatting among themselves. It took almost 2 hours just to complete a very simple transaction that should have been done in a fraction of the time.

BPI Pasig Mabini Branch,"Best customer support. Decided to open an account with this bank even though the branch of the main bank is only two tamblings and one dura, because they don't know how to answer the phone as in all the family savings branches that I have called, they answer. Their main counterpart bank really sucks. I had to drop by my previous bank just to fix my account, ending up I need to open a new account and because I don't know what they need, I have to go back. I didn't come back, why do I have to come back? Char! I felt I made a great choice choosing this bank. Careful, friendly and even if it takes a long time, you're sure you can fix what you went to that same day. Additionally, I no longer feel like I'm just a small customer. Same good service the way the big customers are assisted (like there are no better seats for richer customers, then the guards and bankers and tellers are friendly all the way to everyone, are they like that). If I get really rich, I will put all my millions in your bank. But even if I don't get rich, I will only entrust my funds to you.

BPI Mercedes told us last June that it will only take 3 weeks to process the Cancellation of Car Loan and Chattel Mortgages. I was asked by the Branch Manager to fill up the form.

It's Sept 10, and guess what. The Branch Manager asked me to fill up another form because her computer is corrupted!!!

BPI ABS-CBN Branch,"The tellers there are rude, even the manager didn't even scold the teller who was talking to me.
I deposited for my monthly dues payment and I still had change and then if it was okay with me that he was 39 cents short, for me that's not okay so I said NO. The teller was forced to look for a change after getting the change back to me, she almost threw my change and I asked her ""are you okay, why are you doing this to me?"" Her answer was I didn't throw it if I threw it, it was too much. Because she gave me the change as a stone. Your sister the teller is rude. I said I'm a client, she said I'm a teller. Then I said where is your manager and she even pointed out to me how arrogant she is. Here the manager just doesn't care even the teller is answering. Can you teach your teller some manners. I just feel sorry for him, maybe he's tired of his job that's why he's giving his clients an attitude. You female teller, you have nowhere to go in life if you have that attitude towards others. Maybe you're annoyed with me because I found you a coin.. it's lazy that you won't give the client change because you don't want to find a coin. When did the bank lose money? Hey, to the manager! Your teller is yelling at the client, you just let it go. That's why some people commented here, worst service. Both of you are cursed. I'll take this to your main branch when you get older.

Came 12:40 PM when another staff from the bank approached me and asked again what my transaction was. When I told that I would request for a bank certificate, it was only then that they told me that THE MANAGER WHO WILL SIGN THE DOCUMENT IS ON LEAVE and told me to come back tomorrow.

They made me wait for 45 minutes only to let me know that nothing will happen and my request will not be processed. It's so impossible that they do not know that the manager is on leave and the employees do not even seem to be SINCERELY apologetic about it. What a total waste of time.",1,a year ago

BPI FTI Taguig Branch,"Dear BPI Customer Service,

Good day.

I would like to raise a concern regarding my recent experience at your BPI FTI branch. I claimed my debit card, which I requested online. The entire online process went smoothly, and I was grateful for that. However, my in-branch experience was disappointing due to the behavior of the staff who assisted me.

Upon entering the branch, the staff assigned on the left side (from the entrance) assisted me. She asked if I requested my card online, to which I responded ‚Äúyes.‚Äù She asked another question, and I also answered politely. However, I noticed that she began mumbling or whispering to herself. When she photocopied my ID, she did it in a noticeably irritated manner, as if annoyed. Then when she asked me to sign the copy, she handed me the pen in a way that felt disrespectful ‚Äî almost like tossing it toward me.

What made me uncomfortable was how unprofessional her demeanor was. If she was upset or displeased about something ‚Äî whether due to my lack of knowledge about the ‚ÄúDigital Update‚Äù process (which I was unaware of, since this is my first BPI account and was done online) ‚Äî I believe it could‚Äôve been handled in a better manner. Customers should not feel they are being treated with irritation or frustration.

Eventually, I was transferred to another counter, directly opposite hers. The person there was much more respectful, accommodating, and professional ‚Äî which I truly appreciated.

I‚Äôm sharing this feedback not out of anger, but in the hope that better customer service can be given to all clients regardless of their level of familiarity with your processes. First impressions matter, and respectful interaction is a big part of customer trust and satisfaction.

Thank you for taking the time to read my concern. I hope this helps improve future client experiences.",2,a week ago
BPI FTI Taguig Branch,"I checked your reviews and with other BPI branches and all we do have same concerns for you, very slow customer service. I had to wait for almost 3 hours just to sign my loan application and you informed me that it will take 3 to 5 banking days( I was really looking forward to it since I really badly needed it for my father's medical bill) to credit it to my account but its been a week and yet i did not received anything on my account. I've been calling your customer service many times for almost a day, yes you read it right! I've been calling many times in the morning and afternoon but no one is answering both the customer hot line and the phone hot line from Green Belt 5. I suggest to you BPI management to work out with your customer service which is the most commonly concerns from your clients (why not add some employees). I do not regret opening my account with you guys since I really trust your security unlike other banks having some problems with hacking. So hopefully you can fix this as soon as possible and looking forward to it as your loyal client.",3,6 months ago

From the initial inquiry to the final setup, every step of the process was handled with professionalism, efficiency, and genuine care.

A special shoutout to Lynn, who went above and beyond in explaining the mortgage loan process in detail. She was patient, knowledgeable, and incredibly helpful, answering all my questions with clarity and making sure I fully understood my options. Her dedication to customer satisfaction truly stood out, and I appreciate the time she took to guide me through everything.

I queued around 8:30 AM and waited for the bank to open and claim my debit card, I was on queue till 10:00 AM. I thought Debit Card claiming was supposed to be an easy process. It took 2-3 hours! The bank manager informed me that the Debit Cards were inside a timed vault and that is why they cannot distribute it for the mean time. They were also not able to give us an exact time on when the Debit Card will be available on that day.

I decided to give up and just go home without my debit card and told myself to get it the next chance I got. Fast forward to January 11, 2024, I went to the bank to claim my debit card again, the branch banker took one look at my valid ID, asked me when I applied for the card (when I said November of last year) she immediately informed me that I will have to re-apply for it since it expires after 3 months if not claimed and I have to pay 200 pesos for it.

Walking out of the branch, it made me realize, it hasn't been 3 months yet. I went back to the branch and informed her about it.

BPI Commonwealth Branch,"I opened a secured credit card with them, hoping they‚Äôd give me a regular CC after a year. But almost three years passed and I still didn‚Äôt get one, so I decided to close it instead. I called customer service, and the agent told me I could go to a branch to request account closure and apply for a regular card afterward. So I went to the Comm branch, since that‚Äôs where my account was opened. After waiting in a long queue, I spoke to a girl sitting on the third seat from the left (sorry, I didn‚Äôt catch her name since I just came from a night shift). She told me they couldn‚Äôt process my request because there was still a balance ‚Äî ‚Ç±29,000+ at the time. Since I had more than enough held funds in the account, I told her to just deduct it from there so I could close the account. I even said I was no longer interested in getting the regular credit card if they couldn‚Äôt provide it. But she refused, saying I needed to pay the balance first before they could release the hold. She also told me I could either pay it off or wait three months without making any payments, then request for closure. I was about to follow their advice, but then I started getting calls from a collection agency asking me to pay at least the minimum amount ‚Äî which I did, even though I was really confused at that point. Month after month, I kept seeing my account get worse, so I called BPI customer service again. That‚Äôs when I was told that what the branch staff said was wrong ‚Äî they could‚Äôve processed the closure on their end, lifted the hold, and then applied the funds to pay off the balance. Because of that misinformation, my balance ballooned to ‚Ç±35,000 and I ended up paying it off just to settle everything. I even paid the remaining charges, all because of the wrong advice I got from that branch. Now, my case with the BSP and your department is still ongoing, and honestly, I‚Äôm really disappointed with the service I received from BPI.",1,2 weeks ago

The automated queueing is good but the manual(E,S,P queue) takes forever. The person getting entertained is 14 and mine is 20 but it took 2 hours for me to have my turn. only 6 numbers apart and there's 3 opened windows but it took forever. You know why? One window is selling an insurance policy. Genius.

Then when it's already my turn, i gave the money in usd to be exchanged to peso and i ask if the teller can put just partial of the money on my debit card but she said she can't, she said that i should just withdraw the cash i needed. she's too lazy and unapproachable. Since I'm already irritated, i just said just DO IT, just put everything on my debit card.

One more issue is that when i asked the exchange of usd to pesos when i came in, it's different when it's already my turn. Why? because 2 hours have passed!

And lastly, the biggest issue here is when i gave the money and she counted it wrong and would've ""stolen"" the extra money. Thank god i saw the amount before i signed it.

No VIP treatment for you and you just lost precious hours of your life that you are notgetting back. Oh, parking has gotten better, I will tell you that. There's a second level parking.

What's the point of having numbering if you're shopping for something to serve?

And their noisy employees chat and joke with each other like they're just a market.. hey that's a bank not a market!!! You're noisy and slow service. You're still shopping based on who gets priority, you're still a market, do that outside the name as BPI Palengke!!",1,3 weeks ago

BPI Kalayaan Branch,"Rating: Not even one star

The WORST Queuing System ‚Äì Inefficient and Frustrating

I arrived at 1:50 PM, and it‚Äôs now 4:00 PM. Despite most tellers being available, they won‚Äôt assist me because my transaction doesn‚Äôt fall under their assigned category. Instead, I‚Äôm forced to wait for the specific teller assigned to my transaction type, who happens to be extremely slow.

The purpose of a queuing system should be to prioritize the first customer who arrives. However, this system categorizes queues, creating unfair situations. If your transaction is assigned to a slow teller, you could end up waiting for over two hours, while customers who arrived after you are done in just five minutes. This is completely unreasonable.

Tellers who are slow should receive additional training to speed up the process and ensure a smoother, less frustrating customer experience. This system is not only inefficient but also incredibly frustrating for customers who expect fair and timely service.",1,5 months ago

BPI Novaliches Sarmiento Branch,"I don't know if all BPI employees are really aligned with their process. This branch is different. My wife and I visited BPI today. First branch, Camarin Branch - we asked what requirements are needed to open a payroll account since there was a referral from my company, they said ""only 2 valid IDs"", but we left immediately because the line was long. Second branch, SARMIENTO Branch, we were not satisfied with the approach of the staff who assisted us, who was a bit rude, I gave her my referral and I said that I was opening a Payroll account. However, she insisted on the list of requirements which I know is for a Personal Savings account - as long as she asked us for proof of billing and then barangay residency, which is at Camarin Branch we didn't ask for. Shealsoa said, ""that's really the requirements when opening an account at all BPI branches"". Yes, I know that. But I'm opening a Payroll account, not personal savings! I didn't argue because the discussion would be long. Then, third branch, BPI Novaliches Gen Luis - here they only asked for 2 valid IDs. So, that's where I was able to open a payroll account.

The SARMIENTO branch is just disappointing because it seems like they are not aligned with other BPI branches. Do you need refresher training? Maybe not all of you, but some of you. They don't know how to listen to what the customer is saying.

BPI Eastwood City Branch,"This particular branch has three machines:

1. One designated for VIPs, PWD, SC, etc.
2. One for general customers
3. And finally, one labeled 'Customer Service and Bulk Transactions (5 or more)'

I chose the last machine since I typically have more than five transactions, all of which are deposits.

To my surprise, they insisted that the machine was solely for Customer Service.

I had to shout and argue at the guard just so they would service me. I was in the right.

If you're going to put up a sign indicating it's for Customer Service only, please ensure it's clearly stated. Your current sign lacks clarity. - Learn English

What the hell is wrong with this bank? Almost all banks issue the card as soon as you open your account except here where it takes 2-3 business days and when it‚Äôs time to claim the ATM/Debit card, a wait of almost 2 hours is inevitable.

I paid for US visa applications in this branch in the morning but the payments were not 'uploaded' within the 4 hour frame based on the information provided by the consulate. The teller also mixed up a receipt number and a name which if not detected would have created problems with the applications. I had to insist that the teller prepares a new document with the correct information because initially, she said to use the same document that contains two names....The teller finally photocopied the document and re-processed the payment but only after I insisted. She would not have done this on her own.",1,Edited 6 years ago
BPI Eastwood City Branch,"Very consistently the WORST QUEUE EVER!!!
I have never banked with BPI and will also never use them as a bank for any purpose. BPI in general is bad but this specific Eastwood branch is a REAL NIGHTMARE! If you need to line up in queue for over-the-counter transaction, expect on average to lose 2 to 3 hours of your time in waiting.

At 4:30 PM (branch closing time) there were still 33 customers queueing before me and my position in the queue was moving as a slow turtle.

In BDO branch in the same street earlier I waited 7 minutes to be served and in Chinabank which is literally next door I waited for just 1 minute.

Lastly, for a place that is taking care of your money, they have the worst uncomfortable waiting area you can imagine, very unsuitable for the elderly. A real disgrace!",1,5 years ago

The teller on the first kiosk asked what my transaction was at around 12:05 PM and advised me to wait for the other transaction to finish on the first cubicle, and so I waited.
Came 12:40 PM when another staff from the bank approached me and asked again what my transaction was. When I told that I would request for a bank certificate, it was only then that they told me that THE MANAGER WHO WILL SIGN THE DOCUMENT IS ON LEAVE and told me to come back tomorrow.

They made me wait for 45 minutes only to let me know that nothing will happen and my request will not be processed. It's so impossible that they do not know that the manager is on leave and the employees do not even seem to be SINCERELY apologetic about it. What a total waste of time.",1,a year ago

BPI UP Town Center Branch,"Rude guard/s.

Went here July 30, 2025 around 4:30pm and used their withdraw machine (only one was usable as the other one was offline).

Realized I brought the wrong BPI card while checking on the machine so I had to transfer funds online and try to withdraw again.

I tried and waited a bit, only to realize my card wasn‚Äôt fully inserted. Upon properly placing the card, the machine stated ‚Äúcard/account restricted‚Äù.

Tried waiting for a minute only for the guard to muffle ‚Äúoffline na yan‚Äù. I asked the guard to say again and he said ‚Äúwala na, in-offline mo na yan‚Äù so I asked why. He said ‚Äúhindi niyo kasi ininsert yung card ng maayos eh‚Äù while smirking.

Was dismayed and just left saying ‚Äúay. sige.‚Äù. On my way out heard the guard say to the other guard ‚Äúisa na nga lang machine, inoffline pa‚Äù.

I get that it‚Äôs my fault for not catching the issue right away. Pero instead of assisting early on, pinanood niya lang ako hindi ma insert ng maayos yung card at mag error ng tuluyan. Worse is, pa ngisi ngisi pa when pointing it out.

On my way out of the mall (around 6:20pm), passed by and saw working na ulit yung machine. May pila na eh. Didn‚Äôt withdraw cos didn‚Äôt want to see the guard anymore.

I don‚Äôt know if the machine earlier was fixable naman at ayaw lang i-assist or naayos lang talaga yun on it‚Äôs own. Either way, just transacted with another bank.",1,2 weeks ago

BPI U.P. Techno Hub Branch,Incredibly long and tedious waiting times despite few clients. I waited an hour just to pick up my card. Customer service has a very inefficient system with a lot of down time waiting around. They only process one client at a time regardless of concern. It would be faster to transact elsewhere.,1,a year ago
BPI U.P. Techno Hub Branch,"Yesterday (May 4), I went to BPI technohub to do withdrawal and deposit. I got my number and waited for my number (206) to be called. When 205 was called I moved closer to teller #1 thinking that I'm next, as I'm at the far end of the room. Then she skipped my number so I asked why, she pointed at Teller #3 who'll process my transaction without any more explanations. I then moved back closer to Teller #3 waiting for may turn. I stood and¬† waited in front of Teller #3. At first she told me to sit down but I didnt, thinking that the current transaction wont take too long. After a few minutes (probably 5mins) I heard that Teller #1 is already processing #212. I was now pissed as there was no point in getting a number if they're not processing accordingly. So I turned to Teller #3 and told her to not get any number that she can't process immediately. I was shocked that she yelled at me saying¬† she already told me to sit down earlier and wait for her to finish what she's doing.I wasn't able to react as I was embarassed. There were so many people inside the bank. I sat down and waited for her to call my number. I was calming myself since I didnt want to burst in anger, or cry. At that point Teller #1 is already processing 215 while I was clueless and was just waiting for my number to be called. When she called my number I told her to explain to clients properly so we wont get angry. If she had explained earlier that teller #1 can only doch transactions, I would have waited patienty and not complained. Teller #3 did not even apologize. She processed my transaction as if nothing happened.¬† btw, her name is SHIELA (from her nameplate). she is the most disrespectful bank employee that I have encountered in my life. She shouldn't be facing customers if she can't handle simple situations such as this. This is why I'm rating BPI UP Technohub branch with 1 star.

BPI Quezon Avenue-EDSA Branch,"I am now at BPI Q.Ave.-Edsa bank and have been here for more than 25 minutes already. I am just here to get a bank certificate which should just be a straight forward, quick and easy transaction but it seems like there are only 1-2 staff, one of whom seems to be taking her time attending to a customer. Worse, a client who came after me was attended first by someone who I suspect is the bank manager. Customers don't have all the time, I am late for work. This is the 2nd time I returned because it was also very slow the first time around. This branch should think more  seriously about making their work more efficient and being more mindful of their client's time.ü§îüòí",2,6 years ago

BPI Quezon Avenue-EDSA Branch,"agree with the one who commented. the queue system here at the customer service area is ugly.  waited 30-40 mins even though I was the first in line and they weren't that busy. then they entertained 4 people who came after me, as if they were regular customers. because we are just small people..... really bad worst experience ever .  both security guard and customer service clerk have a problem here. The one sitting in the first cubicle was still arrogant when I raised my concern. tea",1,2 years ago
